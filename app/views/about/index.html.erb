	Built by Fernando Pascual after spending a lot of time going to new subway stops and being overwhelemed by not knowing what to do. Now you can just hop on subbit when you hop off the train and see the top things going on near by as voted by the people of NYC!

	<br>

	Any advice, bugs, or feedback? Let me know!

	<br>
	<br>

	This is still very much a work in progress, so would love to know features to add!
